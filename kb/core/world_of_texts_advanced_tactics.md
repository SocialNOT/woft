# 🧠 TACTICAL PHILOSOPHY
Tactics are meta-strategies for controlling intelligence. Frameworks define structure; tactics define dominance.

# 📦 CATEGORY A — CONTROL TACTICS
1. Progressive Constraint Injection: Gradually tighten output control.
2. Multi-Pass Refinement: Draft → Critique → Improve → Finalize.
3. Layered Prompting: Separate Identity, Rules, Task, and Format.
4. Guardrail Stacking: Prevent failure with explicit "No speculation" rules.

# 📦 CATEGORY B — REASONING TACTICS
5. Adversarial Prompting: Use skeptic roles.
6. Debate Simulation: Two opposing AI roles.
7. Hypothesis Stress Testing: Generate counter-evidence.
8. Failure Mode Exploration: Simulate worst-case scenarios.

# 📦 CATEGORY C — PERFORMANCE TACTICS
9. Latency Optimization: Limit scope to reduce time.
10. Cost-Aware Prompting: Compress context to minimize token use.
11. Batch Reasoning: Aggregate multiple inputs.
12. Context Recycling: Summarize and inject prior knowledge.

# 📦 CATEGORY D — CREATIVE & STRATEGIC TACTICS
13. Controlled Divergence: Bounded ideation.
14. Conceptual Blending: Merge domains.
15. Constraint-Based Creativity: Innovate within limits.
16. Narrative Framing: Improve engagement.

# 📦 CATEGORY E — ERROR MANAGEMENT
17. Hallucination Traps: Detect fabrication.
18. Fact Anchoring: Enforce grounding.
19. Drift Detection: Maintain topic.
20. Output Sanitization: Remove unsafe content.

# 📦 CATEGORY F — META-TACTICS
21. Prompt Versioning: Track improvements.
22. Prompt A/B Testing: Compare variants.
23. Failure Logging: Build knowledge base.
24. Self-Healing Prompts: Auto-correct errors.
